# Sujiko 

In this puzzle we will integrate [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) testing with Noir circuits.

### Goal: Create a 3Ã—3 Sujiko verifier.

### Rules:
- The puzzle takes place on a 3x3 grid with four circled number clues at the centre of each quadrant which indicate the sum of the four numbers in that quadrant.
- The numbers 1-9 must be placed in the grid, in accordance with the circled clues, to complete the puzzle.
(For more information, checkout the circuit file or this [wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sujiko))


## Note:

Within `main.nr` the `main()` the function signature will need to be updated. It currently does not include a return type.

```
fn main(question: pub [Field; 4], solution:[Field; 9])
```

This is to ensure users do not face a return value type error on first compile. The test suit will require a `bool` value be returned from `main()`.

## Testing 

Install Foundry 

```bash
curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
```

Navigate to specific puzzle

```bash
cd circuits/Sujiko/circuits
```

Load submodules

```bash
forge install
```

Generate verifier contract and proofs 

```bash
nargo codegen-verifier
```

Create proofs

Input correct parameters in the `Prover.toml`

```bash
nargo prove p 
```

Run Foundry test

```bash
forge test 
```
