# Sudoku

In this puzzle we will integrate [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) testing with Noir circuits.

### Goal: Create a 4Ã—4 Sudoku verifier

### Rules: 
- There will be 4 columns and 4 rows. 
- Sum of each row/column should be 10. 
- Numbers from 1 to 4(inclusive) should be used for this.
- There should be no repetition in numbers for any row/column .
(For more information, checkout the circuit file)

## Note:

Within `main.nr` the `main()` the function signature will need to be updated. It currently does not include a return type.

```
fn main(question: pub [Field; 16], answer : [Field; 16]) 
```

This is to ensure users do not face a return value type error on first compile. The test suit will require a `bool` value be returned from `main()`.

```

Generate verifier contract and proofs 

```bash
nargo codegen-verifier
```

Create proofs

Input correct parameters in the `Prover.toml`

```bash
nargo prove p 
```

Run Foundry test

```bash
forge test 
```
